# PhotoAppLink
### A library that's gonna change the way you use image apps on your iOS device.

## Usage

We're in the process of getting developers interested in the project right now so we can launch this in late August. If you have an iOS camera or image processing app and want in on the action, send an email to admins at photoapplink dot com and we'll get back to you with details on how and why implement this library.
